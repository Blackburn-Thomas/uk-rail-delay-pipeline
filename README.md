## 📌 Overview

An end-to-end **data engineering pipeline** designed to monitor UK rail operations, detect delays, and surface operational risks through automated metrics and alerting.

The system ingests raw journey data, transforms it into structured insights, and provides both programmatic outputs and an interactive dashboard for analysis.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Rail networks are critical infrastructure where delays and disruptions can significantly impact operations and passenger experience.

This project simulates a real-world operational scenario:
- Detecting delays across journeys  
- Identifying high-risk patterns  
- Providing visibility into causes of disruption  
- Supporting operational decision-making

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Raw Data → Cleaning → Transformation → Storage → Metrics → Alerts → Dashboard
```

---

## ⚙️ Pipeline Stages

### 📥 Ingestion
- Loads raw journey data from CSV files  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Standardises schema (column names, formats)  
- Handles missing and inconsistent values  
- Converts timestamps to usable datetime formats  

### 🔄 Transformation
- Calculates expected vs actual journey durations  
- Computes delay in minutes  
- Classifies journeys:
  - On Time  
  - Minor  
  - Moderate  
  - Critical  
- Extracts temporal features (hour, day)

### 🗄️ Storage
- Stores processed data in a **SQLite database**  
- Enables efficient querying and reuse  

### 📊 Metrics & Monitoring
- Delay rate across the network  
- Average delay duration  
- Most frequent delay causes  
- Worst-performing routes  

### 🚨 Alerting System

Flags abnormal operational conditions such as:
- Elevated delay rates  
- High average delays  
- Severe route-level disruptions  

### 📈 Dashboard (Streamlit)
- Interactive interface for exploring data  
- Displays key operational metrics  
- Enables filtering and quick insights
